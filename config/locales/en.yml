# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        c_branding1: "The word Brand is widely used but often misunderstood, especially in the context of design.
                      A brand can be the name given to a product or service, it can be what many refer to incorrectly as a logo,
                      or in our opinion a feeling & emotion that is experienced when people think of a specific company or commodity.
                      Companies can find that their current identity no longer represents who they are, what they do,
                      or where they want to be."
        c_branding2: "Brand positioning, brand strategy and company vision inevitably evolves over time & communicating
                      this visually can result in dynamic growth & an increased profitability. Crafting a visual identity
                      that is led by insight & positioned accurately to resonate with your audience is crucial, enabling companies
                      to achieve a transcendent advantage over their competition."
        c_design1: "Logos are certainly a strong, symbolic asset for any brand. At the same time,
                    a logo isn’t the only way to define an organisation."
        c_design2: "Visual language, such as colours, graphics, imagery, typography & tone-of-voice all culminate in
                    creating a consistent and cohesive identity that will communicate your values, positioning and personality."
        c_design3: "We temper our belief in change with a conviction that it must be carefully managed. We study the options.
                    We identify precisely where you need to go. Then, and only then, do we look at ways of getting you there."

        c_websites1: "An online presence can often be the most powerful tool for any business or organisation."

                      customers to learn about your brand proposition as well as information relating to your products and services."
        c_websites3: "A professionally designed, meticulously executed website, will utilise carefully considered content,
                      attentive user experience & effective branding. Website design & development is paramount in the pursuit
                      of effective branding & marketing excellence."

                     brand & encourage valuable engagement."

        c_marketing1: "Every business needs to understand the explosive value of effective marketing.
                       Great marketing tells a story about your business and offers your customers a reason to purchase from you,
                       over your competition. It should enthral trust & inspire confidence as well as
                       clarify & demystify your business proposition."
        c_marketing2: "Marketing combines a strategic mix of targeted & planned activities that help promote your brand & your business.
                       Identifying your customers & developing a tailored marketing & communication strategy will contribute
                       to driving the success of your business."

        c_advertising1: "Advertising, on the other hand is a single component or subset of the marketing process.
                         Advertising is a less personal means of communication."
        c_advertising2: "From TV & radio, print & direct mail to billboards, out-of-home & signage.
                         Advertising helps to inform or influence purchasing decisions to a wider audience."
        t_print0: "Print"

        c_print1: "Designing & producing effective printed media can be invaluable in supporting the marketing
                   function of your business."
        c_print2: "The physical, tangible, tactile qualities of print provide a sense of legitimacy & credibility."
        c_print3: "Printed stationery & marketing materials solidify your brand identity,
                   offering strong brand recognition, enabling you to reach niche audiences."
        c_print4: "The facts speak for themselves; consumers are considerably more engaged when reading printed materials than online."
        t_packaging0: "Packaging"
        t_packaging1: "Great packaging protects your brand"
        c_packaging1: "Product packaging is a practical brand touch-point where clarity & simplicity is paramount.
                       The combination of structural innovation, scrupulous substrate specification & outstanding
                       graphic design is critical to crafting great packaging."
        c_packaging2: "Originality, character & memorability are also fundamental to creating packaging that will ultimately result
                       in impressive shelf impact. This will drive product sales, in even the most competitive of product categories."
